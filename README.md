# Imouto From Scratch

WIP.


## Features

1. Vimouto: in-game vim-like text editor.


## Installation

This project uses [LÖVE](https://www.love2d.org/) framework.

Clone this repo. Navigate to it. Run `love .`.

This repo doesn't include any audio because I use non free audios.
You can still play the game without audio.

Later I will include

1. Script for yt-dlp to download the audio.
2. In-game audio manager where you can choose your own audio on your machine.
