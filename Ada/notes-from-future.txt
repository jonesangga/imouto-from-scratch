# Notes From Future

## 2025-11-30

Today nii-san created a programming language for me.
It is called Imo Scheme.

I have never done programming before, but I think the parentheses are nice.
Nii-san also talked about an event called Advent of Code. It begins tomorrow,
and he wants me to join solving the puzzles using Imo Scheme.

Waku waku suru!
